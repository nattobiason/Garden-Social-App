# Garden-Social-App

One of my good friends enjoys growing and *attempting* to breed succulent seeds. He explained to me that breeding seeds of any type of plant can be a fun project, however this isn't any easy procces for several reasons. Specific types of seeds demanded are hard to come by or create yourself, and breeding certain types of plants can require much land usage and resources. So he came up with the great idea that there should be an app that creates a comunity for trading breeding seeds and sharing the results.

This is my attempt at making a gardening social app so that I can (1) solve my friends problem, (2) practie making apple applications, and (3) learn how social apps work and how to make a good one.

This app gives you the ability to (1) share and explore garden creations and (2) trade, buy, and ship seeds with other memebers of your community
